    "\n",

    "# file I/O, network issues, etc.\n",
    "# Exceptions are not known in advance and cannot be predicted at the time of writing the code.\n",
    "# You can handle exceptions using try, except, finally, and else blocks to gracefully manage error situations and\n",
    "# prevent your program from crashing.\n",
    "# Examples of exceptions include ZeroDivisionError, FileNotFoundError, and IndexError.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Syntax Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Syntax errors are also known as parsing errors. They occur when you write code that doesn't conform to the Python \n",
    "# language rules. These errors are detected by the Python interpreter before the program is executed.\n",
    "# Syntax errors can be predicted and are usually the result of typos, incorrect indentation, or invalid Python \n",
    "# language constructs.\n",
    "# You need to fix syntax errors before you can successfully run your code. They prevent the program from running at all.\n",
    "# Examples of syntax errors include missing colons, unmatched parentheses, and undefined variables.\n",
    "# In summary, exceptions are runtime errors that can be handled within your code using try-except blocks, while syntax \n",
