    "\n",
    "# 1. **Encapsulation:** Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that\n",
    "#     operate on that data into a single unit called a class. It restricts the direct access to some of the \n",
    "#     object's components, making it possible to control the manipulation of the data and ensuring the integrity of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. **Abstraction:** Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on \n",
    "#     the essential attributes and behaviors they share, while hiding unnecessary details. It allows you to focus on \n",
    "#     what an object does rather than how it does it, making code more understandable and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. **Inheritance:** Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit attributes \n",
    "#     and methods from an existing class (base class or parent class). It promotes code reusability and the creation of \n",
    "#     hierarchies of classes that share common characteristics and behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. **Polymorphism:** Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. \n",
    "#     It enables objects to respond to method calls in a way that is specific to their individual class while using a common \n",
    "#     interface. This enhances flexibility and extensibility in code.\n",
